						<p>Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das called the coronavirus an "invisible assassin" that could wreak havoc on Asia's third-biggest economy.<br><br>

The national restaurants association, which said its members employed seven million people, warned on Monday there could be "social unrest" if it did not receive financial relief.<br><br>

The commerce ministry has also reportedly urged the government to consider restarting more activities "with reasonable safeguards" even if the lockdown is extended.<br><br>

Even before the pandemic, the Indian economy was stuttering with unemployment at its highest in decades.<br><br>

Some analysts have predicted growth could slump to 1.5-2 percent this year - well below the level needed to provide jobs for the millions coming into the labour market each month.<br><br>

Modi's announcement came amid debates in countries around the world on how to lift restrictions while avoiding a spike in new infections.<br><br>

French President Emmanuel Macron extended a tight lockdown in France by another month, but Italy and Austria are reopening some shops, and Spain is restarting construction and factory work.<br><br>

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned against rushing headlong into lifting restrictions, stressing that only a vaccine can fully halt the spread.</p>
