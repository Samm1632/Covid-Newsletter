						<p>But at the same time, the lockdown, with strict limits on activity, has been devastating for the economy - and for India's poor.<br><br>

Millions of daily wage labourers suddenly lost their jobs, forcing hundreds of thousands to make the long trek back to their home villages, hundreds of kilometres away, often on foot.<br><br>

Some died on the way, while others were shunned by locals when they made it back to their villages. One viral clip showed a group of migrants being hosed down with chemicals.<br><br>

Others have been stranded in cities in cramped, unsanitary conditions where the virus could spread quickly.<br><br>

New Delhi alone is providing hundreds of thousands of free meals to help those for whom the lockdown means immediate hunger.<br><br>

Farmers have complained of a lack of workers to harvest crops while the grounding of thousands of trucks by the lockdown have hampered food transport.<br><br>

Farms, still the bedrock of the Indian economy, are heading into their most important harvest time of the year, when many villages earn enough money to finance themselves for months to come.</p>
